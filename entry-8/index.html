                <p>
                    We're born in a blessed and a generous life<br>
                    And that's why we wanna feel with you all<br>
                    All up and jive
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the moon that shines, lighting up the roads at night<br>
                    Like the leaves in the wind, like the sun that chases the cold<br>
                    Like the earth to the rain, like the sea that waits for the river<br>
                    That’s how I wait for your return, to the land of oblivion
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like my fears that drift away, when I sail in your gaze<br>
                    Like you awaken my senses, with your love-struck voice<br>
                    With your childlike smile, how you move my soul<br>
                    How you steal my sleep, how you take my calm away
                </p>
                <p>
                    You hold the key to my heart, I love you<br>
                    More than my own life, because without your love, I would die<br>
                    You hold the key to my heart, I love you<br>
                    More than my own life, because without your love, I would die
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the moon that shines, lighting up the roads at night<br>
                    Like the leaves in the wind, like the sun that chases the cold<br>
                    Like the earth to the rain, like the sea that waits for the river<br>
                    That’s how I wait for your return, to the land of oblivion
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like my fears that drift away, when I sail in your gaze<br>
                    Like you awaken my senses, with your love-struck voice<br>
                    With your childlike smile, how you move my soul<br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    From the plains, I bring a joropo, with the bass strings in tune<br>
                    Clearing my throat, I see a singing traveler<br>
                    Who shouts with an open chest, full of peace and emotion<br>
                    Colombia, my dear homeland, I carry you in my heart
                </p>
                <p>
                    You hold the key to my heart, I love you<br>
                    More than my own life, because without your love, I would die<br>
                    You hold the key to my heart, I love you<br>
                    More than my own life, because without your love, I would die
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m far from home, how I remember you<br>
                    Living in paradise means living on your land
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Amazon, straight up to La Guajira<br>
                    I know the road is long, but the mountains inspire<br>
                    From south to north, from west to east<br>
                    My Colombia is growing, and that’s how it feels
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s how it feels, if I dare to compare<br>
                    My little land to your sculptural beauty<br>
                    Both so beautiful, like the flowers<br>
                    Both enchant me, they are my loves
                </p>
                <p>
                    You hold the key to my heart, I love you<br>
                    More than my own life, because without your love, I would die<br>
                    You hold the key to my heart, I love you<br>
                    More than my own life, because without your love, I would die
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keké, what you think about the seas of paradise in here<br>
                    This is Colombia<br>
                    When will it be? When we say<br>
                    We say islanders, we all have the years but islanders cannot die<br>
                    A nice place, paradise
                </p>
