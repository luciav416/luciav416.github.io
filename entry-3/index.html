            <p id="p1">The solitude of violence not only destroys bodies but also severs the bonds that once united the community. The plaza, which should be a place of gathering, turns into a battlefield. This is where the isolation of the Latin American soul begins.</p>
            <p class="quote" id="p1quote">"Colonel Aureliano Buendía promoted thirty-two armed uprisings and lost them all. (...)

My dear José Luis, I miss you so much, and it seems we have been forgotten, as I haven't received a letter or telegram; maybe the crickets and cockroaches have eaten the paper. To your dear father, whom I loved so much. When are you coming? We’ve been invited to Sebastopol on Saturday. Receive, with your father, many hugs and kisses from your mother who thinks of you a lot."</p>
