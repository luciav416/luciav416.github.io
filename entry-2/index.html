                    <p>This exploration of solitude begins with a personal journey—my first encounter with loneliness.
                        Even though it happened so many years ago, it remains one of my earliest memories, and I find it
                        almost amusing that, from the very beginning, loneliness was there. I didn’t know then that it
                        would become a constant companion through different stages of my life.</p>
                    <p>I lived in a house on the outskirts of the city, in a neighborhood surrounded by industrial
                        garages and closed doors. My parents worked tirelessly, hoping to give me everything they had
                        lacked in their own lives, sacrificing their time and energy. Meanwhile, I waited in daycare
                        until every other child had gone home, waiting for my parents to pick me up, just to have
                        dinner, sleep, and repeat the routine.</p>
                    <p>My grandparents, who babysat me, were often busy with chores, so I explored the empty house and
                        my imagination. I had a few scraps of paper, old clothes, a TV, and a handful of toys. The world
                        was simple, empty, but still a marvel.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>And yet, there was an unshakable feeling—an ache for something more, a yearning I couldn’t name.</p>
                    <p>When I turned seven, my family could finally afford to move to an apartment complex in a
                        neighborhood full of families, small but beautiful houses, and parks.</p>
                    <p>On our first day there, a Saturday afternoon, I was amazed by the playground in the complex. It
                        was alive with children—laughing, running, and playing together. As the shy kid who was used to
                        playing alone after daycare, the playground seemed like a new world filled with the possibility…
                        of belonging.</p>
                    <p>I grabbed a tricycle, a gift from a past Christmas, while my parents were busy unpacking. I
                        rushed to the playground, eager to play, to laugh, to share with the kids I’d been watching from
                        my apartment window. I circled around the park, observing the children in groups: playing
                        soccer, jumping around, sliding down the slides.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-image">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>At first, I was excited, but soon I started to feel intimidated. I realized I didn’t know how to
                        approach these kids, how to talk to them, or how to join their games. I watched how effortlessly
                        they engaged with one another—laughing, connecting, becoming friends. Each lap around the
                        playground left me feeling more uncertain. The playground seemed to expand, and the groups of
                        children appeared to drift further and further away.</p>
                    <p>Then suddenly, as if it were a sign, my tricycle broke. It snapped into two pieces. I stood there
                        in the center of the playground, which had once been filled with colors and possibilities; now,
                        everything suddenly felt gray.</p>
                    <p>I stood there, holding the broken pieces, watching the other children, so effortlessly connected,
                        and wondered: What secret allowed them to belong? What did they have that I lacked?</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>And so I stood there, surrounded by a crowd of strangers, feeling small, broken, and incredibly
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>I’m not sure if this is what people mean when they talk about the moment we first become
                        conscious of ourselves. But there I was, wondering if the days once filled with wide halls of
                        imagination, cartoons, and toys had been replaced by questions I couldn’t answer. Where was the
                        class that taught you how to make friends? Did everyone feel this way? Was simply being
                        surrounded by people never enough to fill that ache for connection?</p>
                    <p>I picked up my broken tricycle and walked back to my apartment—my new "home." With boxes
                        everywhere, furniture still unassembled, and adults rushing around too busy to notice me, too
                        busy to notice the broken toy or the broken heart.</p>
